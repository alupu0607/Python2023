# General overview
This repository contains all the laboratories and the final project for the Python course.

# About the project
This project implements a GUI client that utilizes the RESP - Redis Serialization Protocol (Details here: https://redis.io/topics/protocol). The application allows basic CRUD operations for Lists, Sets, Hashes, Sorted Sets, and Strings (Details here: https://redis.io/commands). A local Redis Server is utilized for implementation/presentation purposes. For the GUI part, tkinter was used. Note: it does not use libraries that already implement the RESP protocol.

The output after executing an operation is similar to what Redis shows in the terminal. For example, if an operation successfully adds a new member "1" is outputed because the Redis server updated with 1 new member.

When "?" is clicked, details about the specific Redis operation are shown.

To open the project, click on GUI.py. You should have Redis downloaded locally for this project to work.
