# General overview
This repository contains all the laboratories and the final project for the Python course.

# About the project
Implement a GUI client that utilizes the RESP - Redis Serialization Protocol (Details here: https://redis.io/topics/protocol). The application should allow basic CRUD operations for Lists, Sets, Hashes, Sorted Sets, and Strings (Details here: https://redis.io/commands). A local Redis Server can be used for implementation/presentation purposes. For the GUI part, tkinter or similar libraries can be utilized. Note: Do not use libraries that already implement the RESP protocol.

To open the project, open GUI.py.
